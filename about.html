				<p class="col-12 text-center">ㅤHi! I’m Aruna Diza Wahyudi, I was born on July 11, 2007. I'm deeply passionate about psychology and art, particularly how human behaviors and feelings can influence the way we interact with the world and how art can capture those experiences.</p>
				<p class="col-12 text-justify">ㅤ</p>
				<p class="col-12 text-center">ㅤI’ve always been intrigued by why people behave the way they do and what drives certain emotions. Understanding the reasons behind behaviors, feelings, and how external factors impact them is what drew me to psychology. I love learning about how experiences shape individuals and why people respond to situations in different ways. These insights not only enrich my approach to creative projects but also deepen my understanding of human nature.</p>
				<p class="col-12 text-justify">ㅤ</p>
				<p class="col-12 text-center">ㅤThroughout my school projects, I’ve had the opportunity to explore these interests in depth. Working on various projects has helped me hone important skills such as collaboration, critical thinking, and communication. I’ve learned how to work effectively in teams, combining different ideas and approaches to achieve a common goal. Each project has also pushed me to think outside the box, find creative solutions to problems, and communicate complex ideas in a way that resonates with others.</p>
				<p class="col-12 text-justify">ㅤ</p>
				<p class="col-12 text-center">ㅤThese experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but have also deepened my understanding of human behavior. I’m excited to continue learning and applying this knowledge to my future projects.</p>
